FlippyWindow
============

[FlippyWindow][1] is a simple Windows application that non-destructively
flips any part of your screen horizontally, in realtime and using
minimal resources. Flipping images (or viewing things with a mirror) is
a technique used to [help view things with "fresh eyes"][2] which can
aid with [spotting visual issues][3].

FlippyWindow requires Windows Vista or a later Windows operating system
as it (ab)uses the Magnification API.
