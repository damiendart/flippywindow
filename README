FlippyWindow
============

FlippyWindow is a super-simple Windows application that horizontally
flips part of the screen. Flipping images and viewing things with a
mirror is a technique used to help [spot visual issues][1] and [view
things with "fresh eyes"][2].

FlippyWindow requires Windows Vista or a later Windows operating system
as it (ab)uses the Magnification API.
