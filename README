FlippyWindow
============

FlippyWindow is a simple Windows application that horizontally flips any
part of your screen. Flipping images (or viewing things with a mirror)
is a technique used to [help view things with "fresh eyes"][1] which can
aid with [spotting visual issues][2].

FlippyWindow requires Windows Vista or a later Windows operating system
as it (ab)uses the Magnification API.


Building FlippyWindow
---------------------

Precompiled binaries are coming soon so, for now, to use FlippyWindow:

  1) Grab a copy of [FlippyWindow's source code][3] (which is also
  available on [GitHub][4]).
  2) Build FlippyWindow's icon with "BuildIcon.bat" (you'll need
  [ImageMagick][5] installed and available from the command line).
  3) Use CMake to generate Visual Studio bumf.
  4) Use the generated Visual Studio bumf to build FlippyWindow.
